<!-- Create a button that allows the user to request a random restaurant recommendation. Add an event listener in Javascript listens for a click on the button. When the button is clicked, your Javascript should call a new function that you write, which chooses a random restaurant for the user.

You can read more about how to choose a random item from a Javascript array here. -->
